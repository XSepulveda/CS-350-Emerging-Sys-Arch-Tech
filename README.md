# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

**1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**
  
  For these one of the projects, I needed to program the CC3220x-LaunchXL to display SOS using the onboard LED's. For the second project, I 
  needed to create a thermostat using the CC3220x-LaunchXL. The thermostat would tell us the current temp of the room, the set temp, and if the heat was on or off.

**2. What did you do particularly well?**
  
  One thing I think I did well was following the guildlines of the project. I struggled with the project as a whole, but this helped me to know where i need do some additional practicing.
  
**3. Where could you improve?**
  
  I think i need to improve on my general codding skills. I need to refresh my memory on writing basic functions, and i need to get a better grasp on the concepts of binary representation.
  
**4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

  After working with the board, one thing i will make sure to do/add to my support network is throughly going through the boards documentation. Knowing what the board is capable of is a key to saving yourself time in the long run when programing.
  
 **5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
 
  After working through these projects, the projects as a whole help for future projects because its more practice. One thing that i think will help in the furure is using the different diagrams,like the timing diagrams and the state machine diagrams. These help to be able to visualize what is going on within the code.
  
 **6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
 
  I tried to leave comments where necessary, so that other readers can easily know what the purpose of that block of code is doing. This helps me alot, and saves time when looking atunfamiliar unfamiliar code.
